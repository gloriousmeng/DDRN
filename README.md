##  Background 
**DDRN: Deep Disentangled Representation Network for Treatment Effect Estimation**

This is a PyTorch implementation of Deep Disentangled Representation Network for the task of CounterFactual Regression,
as described in our paper, which submitted to IJCAI 2024 is currently under review.

## Requirements
Python>=3.6.8 \
PyTorch>=1.10 \
Scikit-uplift>=0.5.1


## Try it Out
Please first clone the code from https://github.com/gloriousmeng/DDRN.git your local machine.

>cd ..\
>python run.py

## Datasets
In the ```DDRN/datasets/``` directory, we provide the IHDP and ACIC public benchmark datasets.
In addition, to facilitate learning and research for our readers, 
we are planning to make the real-wold industrial dataset used in our paper publicly available. Stay tuned for its release.
